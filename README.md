### **React Learning** 

This react learning is based on Mitrais CDC JS experience and idea on [Pete Hunt react-howto](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto)
and [Dont-make-learning-react-more-difficult-than-it-is](https://www.triplet.fi/blog/dont-make-learning-react-more-difficult-than-it-is)

React itself has a quite small API surface to learn, and in theory, it should be easy to grasp. Unfortunately, the learning resources are making things look far more complex than it actually is and if you’re new to React (or frontend in general) you may find the ecosystem confusing. There are a few reasons for this.

- React has historically been targeted at early-adopters and experts
- Facebook only open-sources what it actually uses, so it doesn’t focus on tooling for smaller-than-Facebook projects
- There’s a lot of bad marketing masquerading as React guides

### How to tackle the React ecosystem

All software is built on a stack of technologies, and you need to understand enough of that stack to build your app. The reason why the React ecosystem of tooling seems overwhelming is because it’s always explained in the wrong order.

You should learn, in this order, without skipping ahead or learning concurrently:

1. ES6
2. React itself
3. JavaScript “bundlers” (e.g. Webpack) and Debugging Tools
4. Redux

### ES6
> ES6 / ECMAScript 6 / ECMAScript 2015 is an ECMAScript standard that was ratified in June 2015 with significant update to the Javascript language

Outside of JSX (which you learned in the React tutorial), you may see some funny syntax in React examples. This is called ES6, and it’s the latest version of JavaScript so you may not have learned it yet. Since it’s so new, it’s not supported in browsers yet, but your bundler can translate it for you with the proper configuration.

#### ES6 General Resources
* **_Recommended_** [ECMAScript 6 — New Features: Overview & Comparison ](http://es6-features.org/)
  Side by Side comparison between ECMAScript 6 vs ECMAScript 5.
* [Top 10 ES6 Features Every Busy JavaScript Developer Must Know](https://webapplog.com/es6/)
* [Convert ES6 to ES5 code in real time](https://babeljs.io/repl/)
  You can use the Babel tool to convert your ES6 code to its equivalent plain ES5 Javascript.

### React itself
> JavaScript Library for building User Interfaces

#### React General Resources

* **_Recommended_** [React: The Definitive Beginner's Guide](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/react-the-definitive-beginner-s-guide-16547)
  Introduction tutorial about how to build simple Pizza Bot application.

* **_Recommended_** [Hacking with React](http://www.hackingwithreact.com/)
 A hands-on tutorial to making a web app using React, React Router, ES6, Jest, and more.
At the end of the forty-some tasks, hacking with React provides a great combination:
  + a progression of straightforward, short lessons toward a working example program,
  + an interesting application (not another To-Do app),
  + introduction to testing with Jest,
  + advice about best Node/Javascript/coding practices,
  + a decent understanding of how all these tools work together, and of course,
  + a great walkthrough of the concepts behind React.

### Webpack
> Webpack is module bundler for Javascript. Although there are a lot of similar task runner and bundler, React community usually use Webpack instead of the others (browserify, gulp, grunt)

* **_Recommended_** [Beginner’s guide to Webpack](https://medium.com/@dabit3/beginner-s-guide-to-webpack-b1f1a3638460#.gy4alqs9i)
